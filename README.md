# Project Overview
A Python-based drag-and-drop file compression utility that creates ZIP archives using Huffman coding algorithm to efficiently compress files and folders. Program  is compiled into a standalone executable through Pyinstaller that operates through a drag and drop interface. The utility employs both Huffman coding and ZIP deflate compression to reduce file size while maintaining data integrity. The program can process single files of any type, multiple files simultaneously, and entire folders including their subdirectories. Compressed files are saved with an underscore prefix because it allows for easy extracting while maintaining a connection to the original file name. When compressing folders, the program maintains the original directory hierarchy within the ZIP archive.
